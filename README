To compile this program, simple type "make" (or if on OSX, "make -f Makefile.macosx").

This will create an executable called "oglRenderer".

PROGRAM: oglRenderer

Usage: ./oglRenderer [xRes] [yRes] < [.iv file]

For example, run as follows:
oglRenderer 400 400 < hw4-data/cube2.iv

The program starts with Gouraud lighting (and obviously lighting enabled).
Press 'w' to show the wireframe version of the object (this disables lighting).
Press 'f' to show the object with Flat lighting (this re-enables lighting).
Press 'g' to show the object with Gouraud lighting (re-enables lighting).

Zoom in by pressing SHIFT and dragging with the middle mouse button pressed.
	(Zoom implemented as a -z transformation based on the vertical drag)
Pan around (move directions) by dragging with the middle mouse button pressed.
	(Panning implemented as a translation in x and y based on the horizontal 
	and vertical drag)
Rotate around the object by dragging with the left mouse button pressed
	(Rotation implemented as rotation around the axis that was dragged, with the 
	angle proportional to the length of the drag)
Exit the program with 'q', 'Q', or the Esc key.
